# Kassen
A home made variant of Kingsen. <br>
Have a new game for each card. <br>
All rules (for each card) must be visible on screen as much as possible.<br>
During a game the screen can be cleared, but must come back after the game. <br>

## Prompt - Information to give:
 - There are piss cards. You're not allowed to piss whenever.
 - The amount that you have to drink is personally calculated.<br>
 You're going to throw the dice to determine your personal difficulty. <br>
 (Don't worry, this difficulty can change during the game.)<br>
 - If you forget any of these rules, you're going to have to drink a random amount, determined by your difficulty.




## Game Ideas:
 - Could have 6 difficulties (determined by dice.)
   - Determining the amount of sips/drinks.
   - Would be nice to have difficulty per person.
   - EG. Reinder drinks more than Julia.
   - <b> Could be increased/decreased by a card! </b>
 - Card that allows you to divide 4 increment points.
 - Card that allows you to divide 2 decrement points.
 - Allowed to talk when light is green vs not when red.
   - Time constraint?  minutes?
 - Pressure game with the song
 - Chug before the light turns off 
   - People next to you take shot if complete
   - Completing reduces difficulty by 2
   - Duration determined by difficulty level
 - Take a random amount of sips 
   - Somewhere between 1 and 10 sips?
 - Goblet of Fire 
   - Your name gets added to the Goblet of Fire that draws a single name of its entrees at the end of the game for a chug.
   - NOTE: Name can be entered multiple times for a bigger chance of chugging.
 - Each color has a rule
   - Left arm up.
   - Touch your nose.
 - Randomly take any old card rule? 
   - Would be difficult as you'd need the old rules as well.
 - Draw random name to play 1v1 game with.
   - Rock/Paper/Scissors?
   - Mario Kart time trial? (Too long?)
   - Tic/tac/toe? (draw = both drink)
