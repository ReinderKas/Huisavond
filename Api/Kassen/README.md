# Kassen
A home made variant of Kingsen. <br>
Have a new game for each card. <br>
All rules (for each card) must be visible on screen as much as possible.<br>
During a game the screen can be cleared, but must come back after the game. <br>

## Prompt - Information to give:
 - There are piss cards. You're not allowed to piss whenever.
 - The amount that you have to drink is personally calculated.<br>
 You're going to throw the dice to determine your personal difficulty. <br>
 (Don't worry, this difficulty can change during the game.)<br>
 - If you forget any of these rules, you're going to have to drink a random amount, determined by your difficulty.
