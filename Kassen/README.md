## Game Ideas:
 - Could have 6 difficulties (determined by dice.)
   - Determining the amount of sips/drinks.
   - Would be nice to have difficulty per person.
   - EG. Reinder drinks more than Julia.
   - <b> Could be increased/decreased by a card! </b>
 - Chug before the light turns off 
   - People next to you take shot if complete
   - Completing reduces difficulty by 2
   - Duration determined by difficulty level
 - Draw random name to play 1v1 game with.
   - Rock/Paper/Scissors?
   - Mario Kart time trial? (Too long?)
   - Tic/tac/toe? (draw = both drink)
