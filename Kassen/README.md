# Kassen
A home made variant of Kingsen. <br>

## Game Ideas:
 - Could have 3 difficulties 
   - Determining the amount of sips/drinks.
 - Allowed to talk when light is green vs not when red.
 - Chug before the light turns off 
   - People next to you take shot if complete.
 - Take a random amount of sips 
   - Somewhere between 1 and 10 sips?
 - Lottery 
   - Your name gets added to the pool that might have to chug in the end.
 - Each color has a rule
   - Left arm up.
   - Touch your nose.
 - Randomly take any old card rule? 
   - Would be difficult as you'd need the old rules as well.
