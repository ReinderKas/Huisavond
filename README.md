### Kassen (Kingsen 2.0)

During a game the screen can be cleared, but must come back after the game. <br>

# Kassen - Games?
## Game Ideas:
 - <b>Global Rules</b>
   - Microphone, can't go over a certain threshold.

---
 - Timing game
   - Option 1:
     - You have 4 rounds (1 round is lighting leds from left to right).
     - Have to time the button such that it lands on the green in the middle.
   - Option 2:
     - Everybody has a button, when the light changes, last to push it has to drink.
   - Option 3:
     - Multiple buttons and leds, have to press the correct button in a certain timeframe, otherwise a shot.

---
 - Electronic shot roulette
   - Create a spinning table with a motorized wheel.
   - Have different shots at different places on the wheel.
---
 - Could have 6 difficulties (determined by dice.)
   - Determining the amount of sips/drinks.
   - Would be nice to have difficulty per person.
   - EG. Reinder drinks more than Julia.
   - <b> Could be increased/decreased by a card! </b>
---
 - Card that allows you to divide 4 increment points.
 - Card that allows you to divide 2 decrement points.
---
 - Allowed to talk when light is green vs not when red.
   - Time constraint?  minutes?
---
 - Pressure rolling the dice game with the song
---
 - Chug before the light turns off 
   - People next to you take shot if complete
   - Completing reduces difficulty by 2
   - Duration determined by difficulty level
---
 - Take a random amount of sips 
   - Somewhere between 1 and 10 sips?
---
 - Goblet of Fire 
   - Your name gets added to the Goblet of Fire that draws a single name of its entrees at the end of the game for a chug.
   - NOTE: Name can be entered multiple times for a bigger chance of chugging.
---
 - Each color has a rule
   - Left arm up.
   - Touch your nose.
---
 - Randomly take any old card rule? 
   - Would be difficult as you'd need the old rules as well.
---
 - Draw random name to play 1v1 game with.
   - Rock/Paper/Scissors?
   - Mario Kart time trial? (Too long?)
